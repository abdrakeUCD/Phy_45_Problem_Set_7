Clearly my plots do not output the correct values, because the sine is a pure frequency and should therefore have one distict peak in its real component and two distinct peaks in its imaginary components. I have not edited the provided code in any significant way however so I don't understand what the issue is :( I cannot figure out why it is not returning mostly zeroes. This issue holds for both plots.
